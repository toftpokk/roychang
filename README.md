Thai Recipes, Simply

## Goal

This is not a recipe book, it is meant to be

1. Reference list of all thai food (as much as I can manage)
2. An attempt to classify/group thai food
3. A personal, self-hosted recipe book

For recipe books:

- https://www.ezythaicooking.com/free_recipes_th.html
- https://www.wongnai.com/recipes
- https://www.pholfoodmafia.com/
- https://thaifoodmaster.com

## TODO

- prawn or shrimp?
- omelet or omelette
- direct romanization or translation

## Notes

- ผัด = Stir-fried
- ทอด = Deep-fried
- นึ่ง = Steamed
- อบ = ?

## Installation

```sh
npm install
```

## Developing
